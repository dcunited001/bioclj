;; additional interesting notes for optimization:
;; if hdist(kmer1, kmer2) > 2d
;;   then neighborhood(kmer1) ^ neighborhood(kmer2) = null set
;; if hdist(kmer1, kmer2) = 2d
;;   then neighborhood(kmer1) ^ neighborhood(kmer2) = {predictable set?} with size d^2?
;;   the set may be somewhat predictable using neighborhood transforms? and ... ?
;; if there are multiple calls to retreive neighborhoods for the same kmer,
;;   this could either be memoized
;;   or could somehow utilize idempotency to minimize function calls
;; for example, if you generate motif on 10 sequences
;;   and those sequences each contain the same exact kmer at least once,
;;   then the function call to this kmer's neighborhood can safely be removed from the calculation for each seq
;;   then or'd into the result later on
;; also, for each kmer in each sequence, their neighborhoods are interrelated since k1 and k2 overlap
;;   but this probably isn't useful in simplifying the problem
;; and neighborhood for AAAA,CCCC is similar because hdist(AAAA,CCCC) = k and because AAAA - CCCC = 1111
;;   neighborhoods for CCGG,GGTT are similar in the same way because CCGG - GGTT = 1111
;; the intersections of neighborhoods AACC,AAGG is similar to CCGG,CCTT because (AACC-AAGG) = (CCGG-CCTT) = 0011
;;   but unfortunately, this problem involves the conjunction of neighborhoods
;;   there might be more to this that may be useful with optimizations
;; and there's probably some interesting stuff to pull in from functional analysis here
;;   since hdist is a distance function, though this isn't a metric space .. AFAIK
;; and there may be a way to utilize the change in neighborhood set from the base neighborhood, a âˆ‚-N(kmer,d) function,
;;   to simplify the disjunction of neighborhoods
